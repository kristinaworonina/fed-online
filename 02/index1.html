    </p>

    <h3>Size</h3>
    <p>
        The domestic cat has a smaller <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skull" target="_blank">skull</a> and shorter bones than the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_wildcat" target="_blank">European wildcat</a>.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat#cite_note-OConnor-50" target="_blank">[49]</a></sup> It averages about 46 cm (18 in) in head-to-body length and 23–25 cm (9.1–9.8 in) in height, with about 30 cm (12 in) long tails. Males are larger than females.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat#cite_note-WCoW-51" target="_blank">[50]</a></sup> Adult domestic cats typically weigh 4–5 kg (8.8–11.0 lb).<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat#cite_note-Mattern-30" target="_blank">[29]</a></sup>
    </p>

    <h3>Skeleton</h3>
    <p>
        Cats have seven <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cervical_vertebrae" target="_blank">cervical vertebrae</a> (as do most <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammal" target="_blank">mammals</a>); 13 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thoracic_vertebrae" target="_blank">thoracic vertebrae</a> (humans have 12); seven <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lumbar_vertebrae" target="_blank">lumbar vertebrae</a> (humans have five); three <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacrum" target="_blank">sacral vertebrae</a> (as do most mammals, but humans have five); and a variable number of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caudal_vertebrae" target="_blank">caudal vertebrae</a> in the tail (humans have only three to five vestigial caudal vertebrae, fused into an internal <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coccyx" target="_blank">coccyx</a>).<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat#cite_note-Walker-52" target="_blank">[51]</a>:11</sup> The extra lumbar and thoracic vertebrae account for the cat's spinal mobility and flexibility. Attached to the spine are 13 ribs, the shoulder, and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pelvis" target="_blank">pelvis</a>.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat#cite_note-Walker-52" target="_blank">[51]</a>:16</sup> Unlike human arms, cat forelimbs are attached to the shoulder by free-floating <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clavicle" target="_blank">clavicle</a> bones which allow them to pass their body through any space into which they can fit their head.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat#cite_note-Gillis_2002-53" target="_blank">[52]</a></sup>
    </p>

    <h3>Skull</h3>
    <p>
        The cat skull is unusual among mammals in having very large <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit_(anatomy)" target="_blank">eye sockets</a> and a powerful specialized jaw.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat#cite_note-Case-54" target="_blank">[53]</a>:35</sup> Two long <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canine_tooth" target="_blank">canine teeth</a> for killing and tearing prey, can stab between two of the prey's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertebra" target="_blank">vertebrae</a> and sever its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinal_cord" target="_blank">spinal cord</a>, causing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paralysis" target="_blank">paralysis</a> and death.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat#cite_note-Smith1992-55" target="_blank">[54]</a></sup> Compared to other felines, domestic cats have narrowly spaced canine teeth relative to the size of their jaw, which is an adaptation to their preferred prey of small rodents, which have small vertebrae.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat#cite_note-Smith1992-55" target="_blank">[54]</a></sup>
        <br>
        The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premolar" target="_blank">premolar</a> and first <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molar_(tooth)" target="_blank">molar</a> together compose the carnassial pair on each side of the mouth, which efficiently shears meat into small pieces, like a pair of scissors. These are vital in feeding, because cats' small <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molar_(tooth)" target="_blank">molars</a> cannot chew food effectively, and cats are largely incapable of mastication.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat#cite_note-Case-54" target="_blank">[53]</a>:37</sup> Cats tend to have better dental health than most humans, with decay generally less likely because of a thicker protective layer of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tooth_enamel" target="_blank">enamel</a>, a less damaging saliva, less retention of food particles between teeth, and a diet mostly devoid of sugar. Nonetheless, they are subject to occasional tooth loss and infection.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat#cite_note-Carr1978-56" target="_blank">[55]</a></sup>
    </p>

    <h3>Claws</h3>
    <p>
        Cats have protractible and retractable claws.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat#cite_note-Kitchener2010-57" target="_blank">[56]</a></sup> In their normal, relaxed position, the claws are sheathed with the skin and fur around the paw's toe pads. This keeps the claws sharp by preventing wear from contact with the ground and allows for the silent stalking of prey. The claws on the forefeet are typically sharper than those on the hindfeet.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat#cite_note-Armes_1900-58" target="_blank">[57]</a></sup> Cats can voluntarily extend their claws, such as in hunting, fighting, climbing, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kneading_(cats)" target="_blank">kneading</a>, or for extra traction on soft surfaces. Cats shed the outside layer of their claw sheaths when scratching rough surfaces.<sup><a href="" target="_blank">[58]</a></sup>
        <br>
        Most cats have five claws on their front paws and four on their rear paws. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dewclaw" target="_blank">dewclaw</a> is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location#Proximal_and_distal" target="_blank">proximal</a> to the other claws. More proximally is a protrusion which appears to be a sixth "finger". This special feature of the front paws on the inside of the wrists has no function in normal walking but is thought to be an antiskidding device used while jumping. Some cat breeds are prone to having extra digits ("<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polydactyl_cat" target="_blank">polydactyly</a>").<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat#cite_note-Danforth1947-60" target="_blank">[59]</a></sup>
    </p>

    <h3>Ambulation</h3>
    <p>
        The cat is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digitigrade" target="_blank">digitigrade</a>. It walks on the toes, with the bones of the feet making up the lower part of the visible leg.<sup><a href="" target="_blank">[60]</a></sup> Unlike most mammals, it uses a "pacing" <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gait" target="_blank">gait</a> that alternates both legs together on each side. It registers directly by placing each hind paw close to the track of the corresponding fore paw, minimizing noise and visible tracks. This also provides sure footing for hind paws when navigating rough terrain. As it speeds up from walking to trotting, its gait changes to a "diagonal" gait: The diagonally opposite hind and fore legs move simultaneously.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat#cite_note-Christensen_2004-62" target="_blank">[61]</a></sup>
    </p>

    <h3>Balance</h3>
    <p>
        Cats are generally fond of perching in high places. This may be a concealed hunting site such as a tree branch, for domestic cats to pounce upon prey. They favor a superior observation point over territory. A cat falling from up to 3 m (9.8 ft) can right itself and land on its paws.<sup><a href="" target="_blank">[62]</a></sup>
        <br>
        During a lofty fall, a cat reflexively twists and rights itself to land on its feet using its acute sense of balance and flexibility. This reflex is known as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat_righting_reflex" target="_blank">cat righting reflex</a>.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat#cite_note-64" target="_blank">[63]</a></sup> A cat always rights itself in the same way, and it has enough time in falls of at least 90 cm (3.0 ft).<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat#cite_note-Nguyen_1998-65" target="_blank">[64]</a></sup> This has been investigated as the "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falling_cat_problem" target="_blank">falling cat problem</a>".<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falling_cat_problem" target="_blank">[65]</a></sup>

        <br>
        The cat family (Felidae) can pass down many colors and patterns to their offspring. The domestic cat genes <em>MC1R</em> and <em>ASIP</em> allow color variety in their coats. The feline <em>ASIP</em> gene consists of three coding exons.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat#cite_note-67" target="_blank">[66]</a></sup> Three novel <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsatellite" target="_blank">microsatellite</a> markers linked to <em>ASIP</em> were isolated from a domestic cat BAC clone containing this gene to perform <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_linkage#Linkage_analysis" target="_blank">linkage analysis</a> on 89 domestic cats segregated for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melanism" target="_blank">melanism</a>. The domestic cat family demonstrated a cosegregation between the <em>ASIP</em> allele and coat black coloration.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat#cite_note-68" target="_blank">[67]</a></sup>
